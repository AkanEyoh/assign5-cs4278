# The RA Helper

My initial idea was to make some sort of texting application to help RAs (resident
advisors) better communicate with the residents they're responsible for. I myself have
never been an RA at Vanderbilt, but I have many friends that are. I can imagine that
they run into many issues trying to communicate with 30+ students regularly 
throughout a semester. So, that was the main driving force behind this idea: to create
software that would help RAs and residents communicate more effectively. 

I have a few goals for the application: a way for residents to notify their RAs of
an emergency quickly, a way for RAs to send their residents information regarding
house/floor events, and a way for residents to get quick information regarding helpful
resources on campus like the Career Center and Writing Center.

Overall, I think some of these goals are a bit challenging but definitely all within
reach of being accomplished. With the answer to my interview questions, I hope to get
a little more insight as to what challenges RAs face and how software could overcome
some of those challenges.

# Answers:

## Question 1: 
"I decided to become a RA in the middle of my freshman year because I wanted to 
be a mentor to incoming first-year students and help get them connected on campus. 
I also liked the opportunity to have my housing covered."

"My freshman year RAs took me and some other international students out for bbq 
on my second night in America and I immediately knew that this was something I was 
interested in: a leadership role where the main focus was on personal relationships."

"I knew I wanted to be an RA after connecting so well my RA from Freshman year. She 
made my Freshman year so much more fulfilling than I thought it would be and made 
my transition into Vanderbilt feel like I was going to a second home."

...

## Question 2:
"I am responsible for getting to know around 45 residents on my floor, and while I 
am not expected to be fully engaged 24/7, my responsibilities range all over the 
place as anytime I am in the building I may have a conversation with a resident 
or respond to a request or question from a resident. At any moment's notice, I may 
be helping a resident."

"Personal crisis care. RAs are first responders to many tragic events. We're often 
the first people on the scene with overdoses or suicide attempts, arriving even before 
the police." 

"I'm responsible for lots of logistical things like doing regular room checks to 
make sure that students are still living in the domrs they're assigned to. In a general 
sense, my responsiblities vary case by case though." 

...

## Question 3:
"I use a GroupMe to communicate to residents about house events like our weekly 
Sutherland Social. I also will give them invitations by hand for invite-only events 
like our Sutherland Cafecitos. I will also sit in the common area and make an effort 
to greet and chat with those who come by. If I have specific requests, I might text 
residents individually."

"I saw them in person quite frequently because we would all hang out in the common 
room together. I would text them individually, but we also had a groupme for the 
whole floor."

"Typically I just use Groupme to send a quick message to all of the residents on my
floor. But if I need to get in contact with a specific resident, I usually send him
or her a quick text."

...

## Question 4:
"Sometimes. Some residents I rarely see around so it is hard to get to know them. 
Sometimes residents are not responsive to texts. Most residents do not say anything 
in the GroupMe and some probably do not check the GroupMe. I am usually able to reach 
most residents by individual text though."

"Yes, and they would also initiate getting in contact with me."

"Sometimes Groupme can be glitchy, so not all the time, but for the most part yes."

...

## Question 5:
"Hank Ingram front desk, Tech Hub, Center of Student Wellbeing, Student Health Center, 
UCC, Project Safe, IICC, and possibly more I'm forgetting."

"The wellness center. It's a great resource for anyone and shouldn't be seen as a 
place to go to only when you're going through stress."

"Student Health Center, Career Center, Writing Center, University Counciling Center."

...

## Question 6:
"It's easy to post the message in the GroupMe and write it on the whiteboard in the 
common area, but I don't know who is getting what messages and who's actually reading 
the messages. I don't know if people plan on coming to events but when the event happens 
they don't feel like going anymore, or if people plan on coming to events but when the 
time comes they forget it's happening, or if people just don't plan on coming to events."

"Yes for the most part."

"Yes, I'm pretty sure my most of residents at least know about every floor event 
when I post about them in the Groupme, but Groupme doesn't have read receipts so it's 
hard to tell who's seen the post and who hasn't."

...

## Question 7:
"There are certain responsibilities like preparing door decs and bulletin boards that 
I didn't expect. Also, there are many small miscellaneous things that pop up that I 
don't plan for, like requests for residents for this and that."

"Yes. Most of my work had very little to do with interacting with residents which came 
as quite a surprise to me. There's a great amount of admin we had to do. In fact, 
admin and event planning is such a large part of the job that I know many RAs who were 
greatly disliked or even hated by their residents yet were held in high regard and often 
promoted to the HR position because they were good at administrative duties and other 
roles that didn't involve personal interaction. Resed is quite out of touch with what 
residents actually want in an RA."

"I was a bit suprised to see how difficult it is to create community on my floor. We
have things like events and meetings where I get to see some of my floor, but I've found
that it's pretty hard to get everyone together even once in a semester."

...

## Question 8:
"Yes, one of my residents was passed out, so I worked through the appropriate chain 
of command, contacting the RA on duty and they contacted the AC on duty, and we ended 
up contacting VUPD for a medical transport."

"Yes. I called to inform the Area Coordinator and also called the police. That would 
be my general approach to the handful of emergencies I dealt with."

"Yes, I called VUPD and the Area Coordinator almost immediately."

...

## Question 9:
"Getting to know my residents, the different things they're involved in on campus that 
I otherwise wouldn't know about, the different stories they have, their excitement and 
energy as first-years that keeps me going, seeing their growth over the year, working 
with my RA staff and laughing and spending time with them, better understanding event 
planning & getting to go off-campus to buy food for events. Being inspired by residents."

"I loved hanging out with my residents, especially those who didn't necessarily feel 
like they were a part of the floor community. I made some great relationships with them 
and feel like I made a difference in their first year experience."

"Even if I don't get to see my residents all the time, I love almost every interaction
I have with them. All of them are so unique and bring something different to Vanderbilt.
And if I didn't sign up to be an RA, I don't think I ever would've met some of the great
people I have."

...

## Question 10:
"Feeling the burden of so many residents & not being able to connect with them as 
well as you'd like. Every time one of them doesn't say hi, or doesn't say hi 
enthusiastically, I feel too sensitive about it. Seeing the attendance of the weekly 
Sutherland Socials dwindle as people get more involved with their extracurricular 
involvements. Not being able to come home to upperclassmen friends. There are a lot 
of rewarding moments to being a RA, but sometimes those rewarding moments are few 
and far between."

"I felt that a lot of the work we did had no impact on the first-year experience and 
was therefore pointless. Logging meaningful conversations, creating bulletin boards 
and other similar activities felt like an unnecessary burden."

"It's really hard to know how my residents are really doing especially when it comes
to issues like mental health. As an RA, I feel like it's my responsibility to be there
for my residents when they struggle with something like that, but with the constant
busyness of Vanderbilt, it's really hard to find time to sit down and see how 
everyone is doing."
